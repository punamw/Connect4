# Connect4

### Assignment Questions
#### Implement a solver or player for a puzzle or game. Choose any puzzle or game that interests you. Bring your program to class on the due date to show the instructor and your classmates. If you made a reasonable effort, you will get full marks.

#### How many hours (per person, roughly) did you spend on this project?  
We spent an average of 5 hours per person on this project.  
#### What game/puzzle did you pick? Why?  
We chose Connect 4 as our game. We chose this because it is very similar to some of the other games that we have discussed in class (it is a 2 player zero-sum game). We wanted to choose something similar to the games we have seen in class, so that we would already have an idea of how to implement a player.   
#### Did you implement a solver, or a player? Why?  
We implemented a player. We chose to implement a player rather than a solver because it seemed more straight-forward to code and it seemed more interesting than implementing a solver. We liked the idea of making a player 
#### List each group memberâ€™s contribution to the project.  
Punam:  Implemented the board class, implemented functions to check for computer win conditions.   
Katherine: Implemented gravity functionality, fixed bugs, code documentation.    
Diane: Researched how about how to implement minimax and attempted to implement minimax psuedocode in python (although this did not make it into the final version of the assignment code).  
#### What part of this project was most difficult?  
Trying to implement minimax was difficult and we were unable to implement it fully due to time constraints. Implementing the "gravity" part of the game was also difficult, originally we had some trouble getting this to work properly. 
#### What part of this project was most rewarding?  
It was very rewarding when we got the gravity functionality to work properly. It is also very rewarding to see the computer beat us when we were testing the code.   
#### What ideas in this project are are original to you?  
The idea of having the player choose to make a winning move, if such a move exists, and to otherwise choose a random move is an idea that was orginal to us. 
#### What ideas are from others? (acknowledge sources on page 1)  
The idea of fixing the board size to a 5 by 4 was an idea that was not original to us (source: wikipedia). Although we did not end up implementing it into the final version of our code, the idea of our player using the minimax algorithm to select it's moves is also not an idea that is original to us.  
#### If you had more time to work on this project, what would you do next?  
If we had more time to work on this project the next step would be to make our computer player "smarter". Ideally we would achieve this by implementing the minimax algorithm.
